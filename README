This project was created by Lior Haleli and Eliana Petel as part of the Hebrew University introductory course to Computer Science.
It was built exclusively in python using the Tkinter GUI module.

To run the game, execute the boggle.py file or type python3 boggle.py in the terminal.

Boggle is a word-making game that requires exceptional vocabulary. The player will have 3 minutes to create as many words as possible from the few letters on the board.The longer words are, the higher the score will be!

If the player gets stuck, he can press the "reveal word" button to display one valid word on the board.
Or, simply click on the "Word length" button in order to find a word of specific length.

Let the game start!
